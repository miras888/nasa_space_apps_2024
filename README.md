Seismic Detection Across the Solar System;

Exploring the mysteries beneath the Martian surface, the Mars Seismic Detector mission aims to detect and analyze marsquakes. By monitoring seismic activity, this mission provides insights into the internal structure and tectonic activity of Mars.

About seismic problems;

Transmitting seismic data from Mars is power-intensive, and much of the data is not scientifically useful. Most of the time, only a small fraction of this data contains valuable signals. By processing the data directly on the lander to filter out noise, we can prioritize sending only meaningful information. This saves power, reduces data transmission needs, and makes it easier for researchers to access the important seismic data they need for planetary exploration.
